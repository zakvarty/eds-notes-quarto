# Reading List {#reading-list} 

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
source("_common.R")
status("complete")
```

This reading list is organised by topic, according to each week of the course. These are split into several categories.

- **Core Materials:** These form a core part of the course activities.

- **Reference Materials:** These will be used extensively in the course, but should be seen as helpful guides, rather than required reading from cover to cover.

- **Materials of Interest:** These will not form a core part of the course, but will give you a deeper understanding or interesting perspective on the weekly topic. There might be some fun other stuff in here too.
