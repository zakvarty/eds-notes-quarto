# Tabular Data {#data-tabular}

```{r, setup, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

```

## Loading Tabular Data


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
random_data <- data.frame(
  id = letters[1:26],
  gaussian = rnorm(26),
  gamma = rgamma(26, 1, 1),
  uniform = runif(26)
)

readr::write_csv(random_data, file = "random-data.csv")
readr::write_tsv(random_data, file = "random-data.tsv")
readr::write_delim(random_data, file = "random-data.txt")
```

Recall that simpler, open source formats improve accessibility and reproducibility. We will begin by reading in three open data formats for tabular data. 


-   `random-data.csv`

-   `random-data.tsv`

-   `random-data.txt`


Each of these data sets contains 26 observations of 4 variables:

- `id`, a Roman letter identifier;
- `gaussian`, standard normal random variates;
- `gamma`, gamma(1,1) random variates;
- `uniform`, uniform(0,1) random variates. 

### Base R 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
random_df <- read.csv(file = 'random-data.csv')
print(random_df)
```

Output is a `data.frame` object. (List of vectors with some nice methods)

### `{readr}`

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
random_tbl <- readr::read_csv(file = 'random-data.csv')
print(random_tbl)
```

Output is a `tibble` object. (List of vectors with some nicer methods)


#### Benefits of `readr::read_csv()`


1. Increased speed (approx. 10x) and progress bar.

2. Strings are not coerced to factors. No more `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`

3. No row names and nice column names.

4. Reproducibility bonus: does not depend on operating system.



### WTF: Tibbles

#### Printing

- Default to first 10 rows and as many columns as will comfortably fit on your screen.

- Can adjust this behaviour in the print call:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# print first three rows and all columns
print(random_tbl, n = 3, width = Inf)
```


**Bonus:** Colour formatting in IDE and each column tells you it's type.

#### Subsetting 

Subsetting tibbles will always return another tibble.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Row Subsetting
random_tbl[1, ] # returns tibble
random_df[1, ]  # returns data.frame

# Column Subsetting
random_tbl[ , 1]      # returns tibble
random_df[ , 1]       # returns vector

# Combined Subsetting
random_tbl[1, 1]      # returns 1x1 tibble
random_df[1, 1]       # returns single value
```

<br>

This helps to avoids edge cases associated with working on data frames.

### Other `{readr}` functions 

See `{readr}` [documentation](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), there are lots of useful additional arguments that can help you when reading messy data.

Functions for reading and writing other types of tabular data work analogously. 

#### Reading Tabular Data

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
read_tsv("random-data.tsv")
read_delim("random-data.txt", delim = " ")
```

#### Writing Tabular Data

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(random_tbl, "random-data-2.csv")
write_tsv(random_tbl, "random-data-2.tsv")
write_delim(random_tbl, "random-data-2.tsv", delim = " ")
```

### Need for Speed 

Some times you have to load _lots of large data sets_, in which case a 10x speed-up might not be sufficient.


If each data set still fits inside RAM, then check out  `data.table::fread()` which is optimised for speed. (Alternatives exist for optimal memory usage and data too large for working memory, but not covered here.)

__Note:__ While it can be much faster, the resulting data.table object lacks the consistancy properties of a tibble so be sure to check for edge cases, where the returned value is not what you might expect.

## Tidy Data 

### Wide vs. Tall Data 

#### Wide Data

  - First column has unique entries

  - Easier for humans to read and compute on

  - Harder for machines to compute on
  
#### Tall Data

  - First column has repeating entries

  - Harder for humans to read and compute on

  - Easier for machines to compute on

#### Pivoting Wider and Longer

- Error control at input and analysis is format-dependent. 

- Switching between long and wide formats useful to control errors. 

- Easy with the `{tidyr}` package functions 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
tidyr::pivot_longer()
tidyr::pivot_wider()
```

### Tidy What? 

![[Image: R4DS - Chapter 12]](images/201-tabular-data/tidy-1.png) 

_Tidy Data_ is an opinionated way to store tabular data. 

Image Source: Chapter 12 of R for Data Science. 

- Each column corresponds to a exactly one measured variable
- Each row corresponds to exactly one observational unit 
- Each cell contains exactly one value. 

__Benefits of tidy data__

- *Consistent data format:* Reduces cognitive load and allows specialised tools (functions) to efficiently work with tabular data. 

- *Vectorisation*: Keeping variables as columns allows for very efficient data manipulation. (this goes back to data frames and tibbles being lists of vectors)

### Example - Tidy Longer 

Consider trying to plot these data as time series. The `year` variable is trapped in the column names! 

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
countries <- tibble::tibble(
  country = c("Afghanistan", "Brazil", "China"),
  `1999` = c(745, 37737, 212258),
  `2000` = c(2666, 80488, 213766)
)
``` 

```{r}
countries
```

To tidy this data, we need to `pivot_longer()`. We will turn the column names into a new `year` variable and retaining cell contents as a new variable called `cases`. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(magrittr)
countries %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = c(`1999`,`2000`), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
```

Much better!


### Example - Tidy Wider 

There are other times where we might have to widen our data to tidy it. 

This example is not tidy. Why not? 

| Team | Variable | Value |
|------|----------|-------|
| A    | Points   | 88    |
| A    | Assists  | 12    |
| A    | Rebounds | 22    |
| B    | Points   | 91    |
| B    | Assists  | 17    |
| B    | Rebounds | 28    |
| C    | Points   | 99    |
| C    | Assists  | 24    |
| C    | Rebounds | 30    |
| D    | Points   | 94    |
| D    | Assists  | 28    |
| D    | Rebounds | 31    |

The observational unit here  is a team. However, each variable should be a stored in a separate column, with cells containing their values.

To tidy this data we first generate it as a tibble. We use the `tribble()` function, which allows us to create a tibble row-wise rather than column-wise.

```{r}
tournament <- tibble::tribble(
~Team  , ~Variable , ~Value,
"A"    , "Points"  , 88    ,
"A"    , "Assists" , 12    ,
"A"    , "Rebounds", 22    ,
"B"    , "Points"  , 91    ,
"B"    , "Assists" , 17    ,
"B"    , "Rebounds", 28    ,
"C"    , "Points"  , 99    ,
"C"    , "Assists" , 24    ,
"C"    , "Rebounds", 30    ,
"D"    , "Points"  , 94    ,
"D"    , "Assists" , 28    ,
"D"    , "Rebounds", 31    )
```

We can then tidy it by creating new columns for each value of the current `Variable` column and taking the values for these from the current `Value` column. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
tournament %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    id_cols = "Team", 
    names_from = "Variable",
    values_from = "Value")
```

### Other helpful functions 

The `pivot_*()` family of functions resolve issues with rows (too many observations per row or rows per observation).

<br>

There are similar helper functions to solve column issues: 

 - Multiple variables per column: `tidyr::separate()`,

 - Multiple columns per variable: `tidyr::unite()`. 
 

### Missing Data 

In tidy data, every cell contains a value. Including cells with missing values. 

- Missing values are coded as `NA` (generic) or a type-specific `NA`, such as `NA_character_`.

- The `{readr}` family of `read_*()` function have good defaults and helpful `na` argument.  

- Explicitly code `NA` values when collecting data, avoid ambiguity: " ", -999 or worst of all 0.

- More on missing values in EDA videos...
